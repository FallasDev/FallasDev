## Hi there,I'm Sebastian🧑‍💻👋


- 🔭 I am currently studying Business Informatics at the University of Costa Rica, where I am in my second year. My program combines technology and business, providing me with skills in areas such as systems analysis, database management, and project coordination. 
- 🌱 I am currently expanding my skill set by learning new technologies, such as Spring Boot for backend development, as I work toward becoming a full-stack developer. My goal is to build versatile applications by mastering both frontend and backend technologies.
